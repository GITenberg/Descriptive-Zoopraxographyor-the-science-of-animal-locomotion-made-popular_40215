<h5>PREFACE.</h5>

  <p>In the summer of 1892 while the Author was in California, preparing
  for a Lecturing tour through Australia and India, he received an
  invitation from the Fine Arts Commission of the World's Columbian
  Exposition to give a series of Lectures on <span
  class="sc">Zoopraxography</span> in association with the Exposition now
  being held in Chicago.</p>

  <p>As these Lectures under the more familiar title of "The Science of
  Animal Locomotion in Its Relation to Design in Art" had already been
  given at nearly all the principal Institutions of Art, Science and
  Education in Europe and in the United States, (see appendix A) the Author
  was induced to believe that they might be repeated in a popular manner at
  the Exposition, with some appreciation of the importance of the facts
  which his investigation has revealed, not merely by the student of Nature
  or of Art, but by that large and important class of students, known as
  the general public.</p>

  <p>Under this impression he delayed his far Occidental expedition and
  returned to Chicago to find a commodious theater erected for this special
  purpose on the grounds of the Exposition, to which the name of
  Zoöpraxographical Hall had been given; the Science of Zoöpraxography
  having had its origin in the Author's first experiments in 1872. It is
  not intended in this monograph to give more than a synopsis of the usual
  course of Lectures on the subject, nor to reproduce any of the pictured
  or sculptured representations which are necessary for its proper
  elucidation, but merely to describe the common methods of limb action
  adopted by quadrupeds&mdash;especially by the horse&mdash;in their
  various acts of progressive motion, and to illustrate the most important
  phases of these movements by tracings from the original photogravures of
  the Author's work.</p>

  <p>In the presentation of a Lecture on Zoöpraxography the course usually
  adopted is to project, much larger than the size of life upon a screen, a
  series of the most important phases of some act of animal
  motion&mdash;the stride of a horse, while galloping for
  example&mdash;which are analytically described. These successive phases
  are then combined in the Zoöpraxiscope, which is set in motion, and a
  reproduction of the original movements of life is distinctly visible to
  the audience.</p>

  <p>With this apparatus, horse-races are reproduced with such fidelity
  that the individual characteristics of the motion of every animal can
  readily be seen; flocks of birds fly across the screen with every
  movement of their wings clearly perceptible; two gladiators contend for
  victory with an energy which would cause the arena to resound with wild
  applause, athletes turn somersaults, and other actions by men, women and
  children, horses, dogs, cats and wild animals, such as running, dancing,
  jumping, trotting and kicking, are illustrated in the same manner. By
  this method of analysis and synthesis the eye is taught how to observe
  and to distinguish the differences between a true and a false impression
  of animal movements. The Zoöpraxiscopical exhibition is followed by
  illuminated copies of paintings and sculptures, demonstrating how the
  movement has been interpreted by the Artists of all ages; from the
  primitive engravers of the cave dwelling period, to the most eminent
  painters and sculptors of the present day.</p>

<h5>INTRODUCTION.</h5>

  <p>In the year 1872, while the Author was engaged in his official duties
  as Photographer of the United States Government for the Pacific coast,
  there arose in the city of San Francisco one of those controversies upon
  Animal Locomotion, which has engaged the attention of mankind from the
  dawn of symbolical design, to the present era of reformation in the
  artistic expression of animal movements.</p>

  <p>The subject of this particular dispute was the possibility of a horse
  having all of his feet free of contact with the ground at the same
  instant, while trotting, even at a high rate of speed, and the disputants
  were Mr. Frederick MacCrellish and the Hon. Leland Stanford.</p>

  <p>The attention of the Author was directed to this controversy and he
  immediately sought the means for its settlement.</p>

  <p>At this time the rapid dry plate had not yet been evolved from the
  laboratory of the chemist, and the problem before him was to develop a
  sufficiently intense and contrasted image upon a wet collodion plate,
  after an exposure of so brief a duration that a horse's foot moving with
  a velocity of more than a hundred lineal feet in a second of time, should
  be photographed practically "sharp."</p>

  <p>A few days' experimenting and about a dozen negatives, with a
  celebrated fast trotter&mdash;"Occident"&mdash;as a model, while trotting
  at the rate of a mile in two minutes and sixteen seconds, laterally in
  front of the camera, decided the argument for once and for all time in
  favor of those disputants who held the opinion that a horse while
  trotting was for a portion of his stride entirely free from contact with
  the ground. With a knowledge of the fact that some horses while trotting
  will make a stride of twenty feet or more in length, it is difficult to
  understand why there should ever have been any difference of opinion on
  the subject.</p>

  <p>These first experiments of Zoöpraxography were made at Sacramento,
  California, in May, 1872. A few impressions were printed from the
  selected negative for private distribution, and were commented upon by
  the "Alta California," a newspaper published in San Francisco.</p>

  <p>Thus far the photographs had been made with a single camera, requiring
  a separate trotting for each exposure. The horse being of a dark color
  and the background white, the pictures were little better than
  silhouettes, and it was difficult to distinguish, except by inference,
  the right feet from the left.</p>

  <p>Several phases of as many different movements had been photographed,
  which the Author endeavored with little success to arrange in consecutive
  order for the construction of a complete stride.</p>

  <p>It then occurred to him that if a number of cameras were placed in a
  line, and exposures effected successively in each, with regulated
  intervals of time or of distance, an analysis of one single step or
  stride could be obtained which would be of value both to the Scientist
  and the Artist.</p>

  <p>The practical application of this system of photographing required
  considerable time for its development, and much experimenting with
  chemicals and apparatus.</p>

  <p>It being desirable that the horses used as models should be
  representatives of their various breeds, and the Author not being the
  owner of any that could be fairly classed as such, obtained the
  coöperation of Mr. Stanford, who owned a fine stud of horses at his farm
  at Palo Alto, and there continued his labors.</p>

  <p>The apparatus used at this stage of the investigation was essentially
  the same as that subsequently constructed for the University of
  Pennsylvania, the arrangement of which will be described further on.</p>

  <p>Some of the results of these early experiments which illustrated
  successive phases of the action of horses while walking, trotting,
  galloping, &amp;c., were published in 1878, with the title of "The Horse
  in Motion." Copies of these photographs were deposited the same year in
  the Library of Congress at Washington, and some of them found their way
  to Berlin, London, Paris, Vienna, &amp;c., where they were criticized by
  the journals of the day.</p>

  <p>In 1882 the Author visited Europe and at a reception given him by
  Monsieur Meissonier was invited by that great painter to exhibit the
  results of his labors to his brother Artists who had assembled in his
  studios for that purpose. M. Meissonier was the first among Artists to
  acknowledge the value to Art design of the Author's researches; and upon
  this occasion, alluding to a full knowledge of the details of a subject
  being necessary for its truthful and satisfactory translation by the
  Artist, he declared how much his own impression of a horse's motion had
  been changed after a careful study of its consecutive phases.</p>

  <p>It is scarcely necessary to point out, in confirmation of M.
  Meissonier's assertions, the modifications in the expression of animal
  movements now progressing in the works of the Painter and the Sculptor,
  or to the fact of their being the result of studious attention to the
  science of Zoöpraxography.</p>

  <p>In the same year, during a lecture on "The Science of Animal
  Locomotion in Its Relation to Design in Art," given at the Royal
  Institution (see <i>Proceedings</i> of the Royal Institution of Great
  Britain, March 13, 1882), the author exhibited the results of his
  experiments at Palo Alto, when he, with the Zoöpraxiscope and an
  oxy-hydrogen lantern, projected on the wall a synthesis of many of the
  actions he had photographed.</p>

  <p>It may not be considered irrelevant if he repeats what he on that
  occasion said in his analysis of the quadrupedal walk:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"So far as the camera has revealed, these successive foot fallings are
  invariable, and <i>are probably common to all quadrupeds</i>....</p>

  <p>"It is also probable that these photographic
  investigations&mdash;which were executed with wet collodion plates, with
  exposures not exceeding in some instances the one five-thousandth part of
  a second&mdash;will dispel many popular illusions as to the gaits of a
  horse, and future and more exhaustive experiments, with the advantages of
  recent chemical discoveries, will completely unveil all the visible
  muscular action of men and animals even during their most rapid
  movements....</p>

  <p>"The employment of automatic apparatus for the purpose of obtaining a
  regulated succession of photographic exposures is too recent for it to be
  generally used for scientific experiment or for its advantages to be
  properly appreciated. At some future time the philosopher will find it
  indispensable for many of his investigations."</p>

  <p>The great interest manifested in the results of his preliminary labors
  convinced the Author that a comprehensive and systematic investigation
  with improved mechanical appliances, and newly-discovered chemical
  manipulations, would demonstrate many novel facts, not only interesting
  to the casual observer, but of indisputable value to the Artist and to
  the Scientist. This investigation and the subsequent publication in the
  elaborate manner determined upon, assumed such imposing proportions, and
  necessarily demanded so large an expenditure, that all publishers, not
  unnaturally, shrank from entering the unexplored field.</p>

  <p>In this emergency, through the influence of its Provost, Dr. William
  Pepper, the University of Pennsylvania with an enlightened exercise of
  its functions as a contributor to human knowledge, instructed the Author
  to make, under its auspices, a comprehensive investigation of "Animal
  Locomotion" in the broadest significance of the words, (see appendix B)
  and some of the Trustees and friends of the University constituted
  themselves a committee for the purpose of promoting the execution of the
  work. These gentlemen were Dr. William Pepper, Chas. C. Harrison, J. B.
  Lippincott, Edw. H. Coates, Samuel Dickson and Thomas Hockley.</p>

  <p>The Author acknowledges his obligations to these gentlemen for the
  interest they took in his labors; for without their generous assistance
  the work would probably never have been completed; the total amount
  expended&mdash;nearly forty thousand dollars&mdash;being entirely beyond
  his own resources. To Drs. F. X. Dercum, Geo. F. Barker and Horace Jayne,
  of the University, the Author is also indebted for much valuable
  assistance.</p>

<h5>STUDIO, APPARATUS, AND METHOD OF WORKING.</h5>

  <p>For a proper appreciation of the care taken in the Investigation of
  Animal Locomotion at the University of Pennsylvania to ensure accurate
  record of the consecutive phases of the various movements, attention to
  the system adopted is necessary.</p>

  <p>In the diagram, B is the <i>Lateral</i> background; consisting of a
  shed 37 metres or about 120 feet, long, the front of which is open, and
  divided by vertical and horizontal threads into spaces 5 centimetres, or
  about 2 inches, square, and by broader threads into larger spaces 50
  centimetres, or about 19¾ inches, square.</p>

  <p>At C and C, 37 metres, or about 120 feet, apart are "<i>fixed</i>"
  backgrounds, with vertical threads 5 centimetres, or about two inches,
  from their centres, with broader threads 30 centimetres, or about 12
  inches, from their centres.</p>

  <p>For some investigations, readily distinguishable in the plates,
  "<i>portable</i>" backgrounds are used, consisting of frames 3 metres
  wide by 4 metres high,&mdash;about 10 feet by 13 feet 4
  inches,&mdash;over some of which black cloth and over others white cloth
  is stretched, all being divided by vertical and horizontal lines into
  square spaces of the same description as those of the lateral
  background.</p>

  <p>These portable backgrounds are used when photographing birds and
  horses, and also wild animals when possible to do so.</p>

  <p>L. A lateral battery of 24 automatic electro-photographic cameras,
  arranged parallel with the line of progressive motion, and usually placed
  therefrom about 15 metres or 49 feet.</p>

  <p>Slow movements are usually photographed with lenses of 3 inches
  diameter and 15 inches equivalent focus; the centres of the lenses being
  15 centimetres, or about 6 inches, apart.</p>

  <p>Rapid movements are usually photographed with a <i>portable</i>
  battery of cameras and smaller lenses.</p>

  <p>The centre, between lenses 6 and 7, is opposite the centre of the
  track T.</p>

  <p>For illustrations comprising both "Laterals" and "Foreshortenings,"
  cameras 1 to 12 only are used.</p>

  <p>When "Laterals" alone are required, cameras 13 to 24 are connected
  with the system and used in their regular sequence.</p>

  <p>R. A portable battery of 12 automatic electro-photographic cameras,
  the lenses of which are 1¼ inches diameter and 5 inches equivalent focus;
  the lenses are arranged 7½ centimetres, or about 3 inches, from their
  centres. When the battery is used vertically, lens 6 is usually on the
  same horizontal plane as the lenses of the lateral battery.</p>

  <p>In the diagram this battery is arranged <i>vertically</i> for a series
  of "Rear Foreshortenings," the points of view being at an angle of 90
  degrees from the lateral battery.</p>

  <p>F. A battery of 12 automatic electro-photographic cameras, similar to
  that placed at R, arranged horizontally for "Front Foreshortenings," the

  battery.</p>

  <p>O. The position of the operator; the electric batteries; the
  chronograph for recording the intervals of time between each successive
  exposure; the motor for completing the successive electric circuits, and
  other apparatus connected with the investigation.</p>

  <p>T T. The track parallel with the lateral battery and covered with
  corrugated rubber flooring.</p>

  <p>M. The model, approaching the point number "1" on the track where the
  series of photographic illustrations will commence.</p>

  <p>An estimate having been made of the interval of time which will be
  required, between each photographic exposure, to illustrate the complete
  movement, or that portion of the complete movement desired, the apparatus
  is adjusted to complete a succession of electric circuits at each
  required interval of time, and the motor is set in operation. When the
  series is to illustrate <i>progressive</i> motion; upon the arrival of
  the model at the point marked "1" on the track, the operator, by pressing
  a button, completes an electric circuit, which immediately throws into
  gearing a portion of the apparatus hitherto at rest. By means of suitably
  arranged connections, an electric current is transmitted to each of the 3
  cameras marked "1" in the various batteries, and an exposure is
  simultaneously made on each of the photographic plates, respectively,
  contained therein. At the end of the predetermined interval of time, a
  similar current is transmitted to each of the cameras marked "2," and
  another exposure made on each of the 3 next plates, and so forth until
  each series of exposures in each of the three batteries is completed.
  Assuming the operator to have exercised good judgment in regulating the
  speed of the apparatus, and in making the first electric contact at the
  proper time, and that the figures 1 to 12 represent the distance
  traversed by the model in executing the movement desired, the first three
  photographic exposures&mdash;that is, one exposure in each
  battery&mdash;will have been synchronously made when the model was
  passing the position marked "1" on the track T; the second three
  exposures will have been made when the model was passing the position
  marked "2," and so on until twelve successive exposures were
  simultaneously made in each of the three batteries. This perfect
  uniformity of time, speed, and distance, however, was not always
  obtained.</p>

  <p>When this monograph was commenced it was not intended by the author to
  give any more than a general idea of the method adopted for obtaining the
  results of his investigation; it has, however, been considered that a few
  illustrations and brief description of the apparatus devised and used by
  him may not be without interest to other students.</p>

  <p>For the use of these illustrations he is indebted to the courtesy of
  Rev. Jesse Y. Burk, the Secretary of the University, and to J. B.
  Lippincott Company, the publishers of "The Muybridge Work at the
  University of Pennsylvania," a book which contains, among other essays
  upon the subject, "Materials for a Memoir on Animal Locomotion, by
  Harrison Allen, M. D.," and "A Study of Some Normal and Abnormal
  Movements, by Francis X. Dercum, M.D., Ph.D."</p>

  <p>Figure 1 is a view of the building containing the lateral battery of
  twenty-four photographic cameras, all of which were used when as many
  consecutive phases of an act of motion were required.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Immediately in front of each of these cameras, and detached therefrom,
  was placed an electro-photographic exposor, a side section of which is
  represented by Figure 2, in which A is a continuous band of thin rubber
  cloth impervious to light; the edges of which are bound with strong tape,
  and arranged to run in a groove, and over two rollers RR which are
  attached to a frame.</p>

  <p>In this endless band are two apertures OO of suitable size, and so
  arranged that their full openings as they pass each other shall
  simultaneously take place in front of the center of the lens L.</p>

  <p>The upper and lower edges of these apertures are kept taut by light
  steel rods attached to the tape binding.</p>

  <p>To the lower rod of the front aperture is fastened a ring C and a
  cleat, to which some elastic rubber bands B are attached; these bands are
  easily removable and their number increased at discretion; in some
  instances of rapid exposures a tension of twenty-five pounds or more was
  required. On a shelf of the frame is a magnet M, over the top of which is
  arranged a steel lever G pivoted near the end D which terminates with a
  slightly indented projection.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:29%;">

    Fig. 2.
  </div>

  <p>The armature of the magnet is pivoted at H; its upper arm terminates
  with a shoulder I. S is a spring to prevent the accidental shifting of
  the shoulder from its contact with the lever when the exposor is ready
  for its function. N is a set screw to adjust the distance of the armature
  from the magnet. To prepare for a series of photographic
  exposures&mdash;the plates having been already placed in the
  cameras&mdash;the end of the lever G is placed under the shoulder I; the
  endless curtain is revolved until the front aperture O is raised to its
  proper position, when the ring C is hooked upon the projecting point D. A
  cord attached to the rubber bands B is drawn around the pulley P, and a
  ring at its end is slipped over a pin, which keeps the spring at a proper
  state of tension. Upon the completion of an electric circuit the armature
  is drawn towards the magnet; the end of the lever is released from its
  contact with the shoulder; the ring C is released from the projecting
  point D; the front of the endless curtain is drawn rapidly downward; the
  apertures meet in the center of the lens, form a gradually expanding and
  then contracting diaphragm, and the exposure is made. A front view of
  three electro-photographic exposors is seen in Figure 3. The first of
  these represents the exposor set and ready for an exposure; the second
  shows the meeting of the apertures at the commencement of an exposure;
  the third, their position near the completion of the exposure, they
  having in the meanwhile uncovered the lens to their full capacity.</p>

  <p>Figure 4 illustrates a portable battery of twelve electro-photographic
  exposors; it consists of a rectangular box divided into compartments,
  open at the front and rear.</p>

  <p>In twelve of these compartments are arranged rollers, curtains,
  magnets, etc., as previously described, and a compartment through which a
  focusing lens is used. The two end compartments provide for the
  adjustment of the camera, which is supported in the box to the rear of
  the exposing arrangements. A cable of insulated wires for connecting the
  twelve magnets with the exposing motor, contains a wire for the return
  current. As seen in the engraving, seven of the magnets by the passage of
  their respective currents have completed their releasing operations. In
  the eighth compartment the two apertures in the exposing band are in the
  act of effecting an exposure. The remaining four magnets are awaiting
  their turn for action.</p>

  <p>Figure 5 is a photographic camera divided into thirteen compartments,
  each having a lens of the same construction, and the same focal length;
  these are arranged to correspond with the compartments in the
  electro-exposors.</p>

  <p>One of the lenses is provided with a focusing screen, and with it the
  other twelve lenses are adjusted to a proper focus without removing the
  plate holder behind them from its position in the camera.</p>

  <p>The plate holder is constructed to hold three dry plates, each three
  inches by twelve inches; the front is divided into twelve compartments,
  each three inches square.</p>

  <p>Light is excluded from the front by a roller blind, strengthened by
  thin narrow slats of hard wood; the blind works in grooves, is drawn over
  a concealed roller, and covers the back of the holder when the plates are
  being exposed.</p>

  <p>Figure 6 is a rear and side view of the circuit maker, conventionally
  called the exposing motor.</p>

  <p>The motive power is an adjustable weight attached to a cord which is
  wound around a drum. Twenty-four binding posts are attached to the table
  at the back of the exposing motor; other binding posts are arranged for
  return or other currents.</p>

  <p>Figure 7 illustrates a front and side view of the upper part of the
  exposing motor. Fastened to the frame is a ring of hard rubber, in which
  are inserted twenty-four insulated segments of platinum-coated brass;
  these segments are connected by insulated wires to the twenty-four
  binding posts on the back of the motor table, figure 6.</p>

  <p>A shaft, connected by an arrangement of geared wheels to the drum,
  passes through the center of the segmented ring and carries a loose
  collar; a stout metal rod is firmly attached near its longitudinal center
  to this loose collar. One arm of the rod carries a laminated metal
  scraper, or contact brush, arranged to travel around the periphery of the
  ring, and in its revolution to make contact with each segment in
  succession. The contact brush is connected through the arm with one pole
  of the battery; and each segment&mdash;through its independent wire and
  magnet of the electro-exposors&mdash;with the other pole.</p>

  <p>When twenty-four consecutive phases of an act of motion are to be
  photographed from one point of view, all of the insulated segments in the
  ring are put in circuit. When twelve consecutive phases are to be
  photographed synchronously from each of three points of view, each
  alternate segment is placed in circuit with the electric battery.</p>

  <p>The manner in which the series of synchronous exposures is effected
  will be readily understood by reference to the diagram, 8.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:52%;">

  <p>All being in readiness, and the weights and fan wheel adjusted to
  cause the contact brush to sweep over the periphery of the ring at the
  required rate of speed, the drum, and with it the shaft is set in
  motion.</p>

  <p>At the proper time, pressure on a button completes an independent
  circuit through the magnet seen below the segmented ring, figure 7, and
  in the side diagram of figure 8.</p>

  <p>The action of the armature releases the lower end of the rod on the
  loose collar, which, by means of a coiled spring, is immediately thrown
  into gearing with the already revolving shaft; the contact brush sweeps
  around the segmented ring and effects the consecutive series of exposures
  at the pre-arranged intervals of time.</p>

  <p>At the University the intervals varied from the one-sixtieth part of a
  second to several seconds.</p>

  <p>A record of these time intervals was kept by a chronograph, a well
  known instrument; it comprises a revolving drum carrying a cylinder of
  smoke-blackened paper, on which, by means of successive electric
  contacts, a pencil is caused to record the vibrations of a tuning fork,
  while a second pencil marks the commencement of each photographic
  exposure. The number of vibrations occurring between any two successive
  exposures marks the time. The tuning fork used made one hundred single
  vibrations in a second of time. To ensure greater minuteness and accuracy
  in the record, the vibrations were divided into tenths, and the intervals
  calculated in thousandths of a second.</p>

  <p>For the purpose of determining the synchronous action of the
  electro-exposors while making a double series of exposures, the accuracy
  of the time intervals as recorded by the chronograph, and the duration of
  the shortest photographic exposures used in the investigation, the two
  batteries of portable cameras were placed side by side, and the exposors
  were each connected with the exposing motor by separate lengths of a
  hundred feet of cable. The two series of cameras were pointed to a
  rapidly revolving disc of five feet diameter. The surface of the disc was
  black, with narrow white lines radiating from the center to the edge like
  the spokes of a wheel. A microscopic examination of the two series of
  resulting negatives proved that no variation could be discovered in the
  synchronous action of ten of the duplicated series of exposures, and that
  in the remaining two a variation existed in the simultaneity of a few
  ten-thousandths of a second&mdash;a result sufficiently near to
  simultaneity for all ordinary photographic work.</p>

    Fig. 9.
  </div>

  <p>A reproduction of the chronographic record of one of these experiments
  is seen in figure 9.</p>

  <p>The first line records the revolution of the disc; the second the
  vibration of the tuning fork; and each group of three long double
  markings in the third line indicates a photographic exposure.</p>

  <p>The shortest exposures made at the University
  were&mdash;approximately&mdash;the one six-thousandth part of a second;
  such brief exposures are however for this class of investigation very
  rarely needed.</p>

  <p>Some horses galloping at full speed will, for a short distance, cover
  about fifty-six or fifty-eight feet of ground in a second of time; a full
  mile averaging perhaps a hundred seconds. At this speed, a foot
  recovering its loss of motion will be thrust forward with an occasional
  velocity of at least 120 lineal feet in a second of time.</p>

  <p>During the one one-thousandth part of a second the body of the horse
  will at this rate move forward about seven one-tenths of an inch, and a
  moving foot perhaps one and a half inches, not a very serious matter for
  the usual requirements of the amateur photographer.</p>

  <p>A knowledge of the duration of the exposures, however, was in this
  investigation of no value, and scarcely a matter of curiosity, the aim
  always being to give as long an exposure as the rapidity of the action
  would permit, with a due regard to the necessary sharpness of outline,
  and essential distinctness of detail.</p>

  <p>The power used for operating the magnets, through the exposing motor,
  was given from a lé Clanché battery of fifty-four cells, arranged in
  multiple arc of three series, each of eighteen cells.</p>

  <p>During the investigation at the University of Pennsylvania, more than
  a hundred thousand photographic exposures were made.</p>

  <p>The negative plates were supplied by the Cramer Dry Plate Company of
  St. Louis, and the positive plates by the Carbutt Company of
  Philadelphia. On a favorable day five hundred or six hundred negatives
  were sometimes exposed; on one day the number of exposures reached seven
  hundred and fifty.</p>

  <p>The electrical manipulations were directed by Lino F. Rondinella; the
  development room was in charge of Henry Bell. The author takes pleasure
  in acknowledging the skill, patience and energy which these gentlemen
  exhibited in their respective fields of labor.</p>

  <p>Although the one six-thousandth part of a second was the duration of
  the most rapid exposure made in this investigation, it is by no means the
  limit of mechanically effected photographic exposures, nor does the
  one-sixtieth part of a second approach the limit of time intervals.
  Marey, in his remarkable physiological investigations, has recently made
  successive exposures with far less intervals of time; and the author has
  devised, and when a relaxation of the demands upon his time permit, will
  use an apparatus which will photograph twenty consecutive phases of a
  single vibration of the wing of an insect; even assuming as correct a
  quotation from <i>Nicholson's Journal</i> by Pettigrew in his work on
  Animal Locomotion that a common house fly will make during flight seven
  hundred and fifty vibrations of its wings in a second of time, a number
  probably far in excess of the reality.</p>

  <p>The ingenious gentlemen who are persistently endeavoring to overcome
  the obstacles in the construction of an apparatus for aerial navigation,
  will perhaps some day be awakened by the fact that the only successful
  method of propulsion will be found in the action of the wing of an
  insect.</p>

  <p>We will now resume the subject proper of this monograph.</p>

  <p>It is impossible within its limits to trace the history of the art of
  delineating animals in motion, or to illustrate it with examples of the
  truthful impressions of the primitive Artists, or of the imaginative and
  erroneous conceptions of many of those of modern times. Certain phases of
  the facts of Animal Locomotion will alone be treated upon, as
  demonstrated by photographic research.</p>

  <p>The illustrations and condensed definitions of the various gaits were
  prepared by the Author for the "Standard Dictionary." Before studying
  these it is essential that the meaning of the terms <i>step</i> and
  <i>stride</i> should be distinctly understood.</p>

  <p>A <span class="sm">STEP</span> is an act of progressive animal motion,
  in which one of the supporting members of the body is thrust in the
  direction of the motion and the support transferred, wholly, or in part,
  from one member to another.</p>

  <p>A <span class="sm">STRIDE</span> is an act of progressive animal
  motion, which, for its completion, requires all of the supporting members
  of the body, in the exercise of their proper functions, to be
  consecutively and regularly thrust in the direction of the movement until
  they hold the same relative positions in respect to each other as they
  did at the commencement of the notation. In the bipedal walk or run a
  step is one-half of a stride or full round movement. With all quadrupeds,
  except the kangaroo and other jumpers, <i>four</i> steps are necessary to
  complete the stride.</p>

<h5>THE WALK.</h5>

  <p>The <span class="sm">WALK</span> is a method of progressive motion
  with a regular individual succession of limb movements. In the evolution
  of the terrestrial vertebrates the walk was probably the first adopted
  method of locomotion, and its execution is regulated by the law that the
  movement of the <i>superior</i> limb precedes the movement of its lateral
  <i>inferior</i> limb. This is proved not merely by the <i>ordinary</i>
  quadrupedal walk, but by the suspended motion of the sloth; the crawling
  of the child upon the ground, the erect walk of man; and the inverse limb
  movements of the ape tribe.</p>

  <p>The relative time intervals of the foot-fallings vary greatly with
  many species of animals, and even with the same animal under different
  conditions.</p>

  <p>Selecting the horse for the purpose of illustration we find that
  during the walk&mdash;his slowest progressive movement&mdash;he has
  always two, and for a varying period of time, or distance, three feet on
  the ground at once, while during a very slow walk the support will
  devolve alternately upon three feet and upon four feet.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:44%;">
      <a href="images/illus_046.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illus_046.jpg"
      alt="Some consecutive phases of the walk." title="Some consecutive phases of the walk." /></a>
    SOME CONSECUTIVE PHASES OF THE WALK.
  </div>

  <p>If the notation of the foot-fallings commences with the landing of the
  right hind foot, the order in which the other feet are placed upon the
  ground will be: the right fore, the left hind, and the left fore,
  commencing again with the right hind.</p>

  <p>Assuming that our observation of the stride of a horse during an
  ordinary walk commences with the landing of the right hind foot, the body
  will then be supported by both hind and the left fore feet. The left hind
  is now lifted, the support of the body devolves upon the
  diagonals&mdash;the right hind and left fore&mdash;and continues so
  supported until the left hind is in the act of passing to the front of
  the right; when the right fore is next placed on the ground. The left
  fore is now raised, and the body is supported by the right laterals,
  until the landing of the left hind foot relieves its fellow hind of a
  portion of its weight. Two steps or one-half of a stride have now been
  made, and with the substitution of the right feet for the left, two other
  steps will be executed in practically the same manner, and a full stride
  will have been completed. We thus see that during the walk a quadruped is
  supported by eight different methods, the supporting limbs being
  consecutively:</p>

  <p>Both hind and left fore.</p>

  <p>Right hind and left fore <i>diagonals</i>.</p>

  <p>Right hind and both fore.</p>

  <p>Right hind and right fore <i>laterals</i>.</p>

  <p>Both hind and right fore.</p>

  <p>Left hind and right fore <i>diagonals</i>.</p>

  <p>Left hind and both fore.</p>

  <p>Left hind and left fore <i>laterals</i>.</p>

  <p>Followed as at the commencement with both hind and left fore.</p>

  <p>When, therefore, during a walk, a horse is supported on two legs, with
  two feet suspended between them, each pair are laterals. On the other
  hand, when the suspended feet are respectively in advance of, and behind
  the supporting legs, each pair are diagonals.</p>

  <p>These invariable rules have been unknown or ignored by many
  distinguished artists of modern times.</p>

<h5>THE AMBLE.</h5>

  <p>The amble is a method of progressive motion with the same sequence of
  foot fallings as the walk, but in which a hind foot or a fore foot is
  lifted from the ground in advance of its fellow hind foot or its fellow
  fore foot being placed thereon. The support of the body therefore
  devolves alternately upon a single foot and upon two feet; the single
  foot being alternately a hind foot and a fore foot, and the two feet
  being alternately laterals and diagonals. At no time is the body entirely
  unsupported.</p>

  <p>The following series of illustrations will clearly demonstrate the
  consecutive foot fallings and some characteristic phases of an ambling
  stride:</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:40%;">
      <a href="images/illus_049.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illus_049.jpg"
      alt="Some consecutive phases of the amble." title="Some consecutive phases of the amble." /></a>
    SOME CONSECUTIVE PHASES OF THE AMBLE.
  </div>

  <p>The amble has various local names, such as the "single foot," the "fox
  trot," etc. It has sometimes been erroneously confused with the rack or
  the so-called "pace;" it is the most gentle and agreeable to the rider of
  all methods of locomotion of the horse, while the rack is the most
  ungraceful and disagreeable.</p>

  <p>In Scott's romances are many allusions to the "ambling palfry." Ben
  Jonson in "Every Man in His Humor" speaks of going "out of the old
  hackney-pace to a fine, easy amble," and Dickens in "Barnaby Rudge"
  refers to "the gray mare breaking from her sober amble into a gentle
  trot."</p>

  <p>The ambling gait is natural to the elephant, and to the horse, the
  mule and the ass; but in many countries these latter animals are not
  encouraged in its use.</p>

<h5>THE TROT.</h5>

  <p>The trot is a more or less rapid progressive motion of a quadruped in
  which the diagonal limbs act nearly simultaneously in being alternately
  lifted from and placed on the ground, and in which the body of the animal
  is entirely unsupported twice during each stride.</p>

  <p>Selecting for the purpose of illustration the phases occurring during
  two steps or one-half of a stride of 18 feet in length by a horse
  trotting at the rate of a mile in two minutes and twelve seconds, we find
  that at the instant his right fore foot strikes the ground, the left hind
  foot is a few inches behind the point where it will presently strike. As
  the feet approach the ground, the right hind leg is drawn forward with
  the pastern nearly horizontal, while the left fore leg is flexed under
  the body. After the feet strike the ground and the legs approach a
  vertical position the pasterns are gradually lowered, and act as springs
  to break the force of the concussion until they are sometimes bent to a
  right angle with the legs.</p>

  <p>At this period the fore foot is raised so high as to frequently strike
  the elbow, while the diagonal hind foot is comparatively but little above
  the ground, and is about to pass to the front of the left hind.</p>

  <p>The pasterns gradually rise as the legs pass the vertical until the
  right fore foot has left the ground and the last propelling force is
  being exercised by the left hind foot; which accomplished, the animal is
  in mid air.</p>

  <p>The right hind foot continues its onward motion until it is sometimes
  much in advance of its lateral fore foot, the former, however, being
  gradually lowered, while the latter is being raised. The right hind and
  both fore legs are now much flexed, while the left hind is stretched
  backwards to its greatest extent with the bottom of the foot turned
  upwards, the left fore leg is being thrust forwards and gradually
  straightened, with the toe raised as the foot approaches the ground;
  which accomplished, with a substitution of the left limbs for the right,
  we find them in the same relative positions as when we commenced our
  examination, and one-half of the stride is completed.</p>

    SOME CONSECUTIVE PHASES OF THE TROT.
  </div>

  <p>With slight and immaterial differences, such as might be caused by
  irregularities of the ground, these movements are repeated by the other
  pair of diagonals, and the stride is then complete.</p>

  <p>If the stride of a trotting horse is divided into two portions,
  representing the comparative distances traversed by the aggregate of the
  body while the feet are in contact with, and while they are entirely
  clear of, the ground, the relative measurements will be found to vary
  very greatly, they being contingent upon length of limb, weight, speed,
  and other circumstances.</p>

  <p>Heavily built horses will sometimes merely drag the feet just above
  the surface, but, in every instance of a trot, the <i>weight</i> of the
  body is really unsupported twice during each stride. It sometimes happens
  that a fast trotter, during the four steps of a stride, will have all his
  feet clear of the ground for a distance exceeding one-half of the length
  of the entire stride. Upon landing, a fore foot almost always precedes
  its diagonal hind.</p>

  <p>It will be observed in the illustrations that while during the fast
  trot the fore feet are lifted so high that they frequently strike the
  breast, the hind feet are raised but little above the surface of the
  ground. The trot is common to all the single-toed and to nearly all the
  cloven-footed and soft-footed animals. It has, however, not been recorded
  as being adopted by the elephant, the camel, or the giraffe.</p>

<h5>THE RACK.</h5>

  <p>The rack, sometimes miscalled the "pace," is a method of quadrupedal
  locomotion in which two lateral feet with nearly synchronous action are
  placed upon and lifted from the ground alternately with the other
  laterals, the body of the animal being in the intervals entirely without
  support. The distance which the propelling feet hurl the animal through
  the air depends, as with other movements, upon a variety of
  circumstances; at a high rate of speed the distance will be about
  one-half the total length of the stride. Upon landing, a hind foot
  usually precedes its lateral fore.</p>

    SOME CONSECUTIVE PHASES OF THE RACK.
  </div>

  <p>The rack is an ungraceful gait of the horse, and disagreeable to those
  who seek comfort in riding.</p>

  <p>The movements hitherto described are regular in their action, and a
  stride may be divided into two parts, each of which&mdash;with a change
  of limbs&mdash;is practically similar to the other; we now come to
  methods of progression which cannot be so divided, and each stride must
  be considered as a unit of motion.</p>

<h5>THE CANTER.</h5>

  <p>In the canter we discover the same sequence of foot fallings as in the
  walk, but not with the same harmonious intervals of time. The gait
  resembles the gallop in respect to its leaving the horse entirely
  unsupported for a varying period of time, and in the fact that the spring
  into the air is always effected from a fore foot, and the landing upon
  the diagonal hind foot; in other respects it materially differs from that
  method of progression.</p>

  <p>Assuming that during a stride of the canter a horse springs into the
  air from a left fore foot, the right hind foot will first reach the
  ground; the two fore legs will at this time be flexed under the body, the
  right being the first landed, and for a brief period of time the support
  will devolve upon the laterals. The right fore foot is rapidly followed
  by the left hind. During a very slow canter the other fore foot will
  sometimes be landed in advance of the lifting of its diagonal, and the
  curious phase presented of all of the feet being in contact with the
  ground at the same instant. Usually, however, the first hind foot to
  touch the ground will be lifted, and the support thrown upon the
  diagonals.</p>

  <p>The left fore is now brought down, and is followed by the lifting of
  the right fore; when the left laterals assume the duty of support. The
  left hind is now raised, and with a final thrust of the left fore foot
  the animal is projected into the air, to land again upon its diagonal,
  and repeat the same sequence of movements.</p>

  <p>The above phases are selected from a single complete stride, in which
  the landing occurs on the <i>right</i> hind foot. Had the horse sprung
  from a <i>right</i> fore foot, the right and left feet would have been
  reversed through the entire series.</p>

    SOME CONSECUTIVE PHASES OF THE CANTER.
  </div>

<h5>THE GALLOP.</h5>

  <p>The gallop is the most rapid method of quadrupedal motion; in its
  action the feet are independently brought to the ground; the spring into
  the air as in the canter is effected from a fore foot, and the landing
  upon the diagonal hind foot.</p>

  <p>The phases illustrated are selected from the stride of a thorough-bred
  Kentucky horse, galloping at the rate of a mile in a hundred seconds,
  with a stride of about twenty-one lineal feet.</p>

  <p>The length of stride and the distance which the body is carried
  forward without support depend upon many circumstances, such as the
  breed, build and condition of the horse, speed, track, etc.</p>

  <p>The phases illustrated and the measurement given apply to one stride
  of one horse, but may be considered as fairly representing the stride of
  a first-class horse in prime racing condition at the height of his speed,
  upon a good track.</p>

  <p>Assuming&mdash;as in this instance&mdash;the springing into the air to
  have been effected from the right fore foot, the landing will take place
  in advance of the centre of gravity, upon the diagonal, or left hind
  foot; above, will be suspended the right hind foot, and at a higher
  elevation, several inches to the rear, will be the right fore foot, with
  the sole turned upward. The left fore leg will be in advance of the
  right, and also flexed. The force of the impact and the weight of the
  horse causes the pastern to form a right angle with the leg, and the heel
  is impressed into the ground.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:46%;">
      <a href="images/illus_057.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illus_057.jpg"
      alt="Some consecutive phases of the rack." title="Some consecutive phases of the rack." /></a>
    SOME CONSECUTIVE PHASES OF THE GALLOP.
  </div>

  <p>The right hind foot strikes the ground and shares the weight of the
  body. The left hind foot leaves the ground while the right hind pastern
  is in its horizontal phase, supporting all the weight. At this period the
  left fore leg is perfectly straight, with the toe much higher than the
  heel, and is thrust forward until the pastern joint is vertical with the
  nose, the right fore knee is bent at a right angle. The left fore foot
  now strikes and these diagonals are for a brief period upon the ground
  together. The left fore leg, however, immediately assumes the entire
  responsibility of support and attains a vertical position, with the
  pastern at a right angle. The right fore leg becomes perfectly rigid, and
  is thrust forward to its fullest extent. The right fore foot now strikes
  the ground, the two fore legs form a right angle, and the hind feet are
  found thrust backward, the right to its fullest extent. The left fore leg
  having completed its functions of support, is now lifted, and the weight
  transferred to the right fore foot alone, which is soon found behind the
  centre of gravity; the left hind foot passes to the front of the right
  fore leg, which, exercising its final act of propulsion, thrusts the
  horse through the air; the left hind foot descends; the stride is
  completed, and the consecutive phases are renewed. From this analysis we
  learn that if the spring is made from the right fore foot during the
  rapid gallop of a thoroughbred horse, it is supported consecutively
  by</p>

  <p>The left hind foot.</p>

  <p>Both hind feet.</p>

  <p>The right hind foot.</p>

  <p>The right hind and the left fore feet.</p>

  <p>The left fore foot.</p>

  <p>Both fore feet.</p>

  <p>The right fore foot.</p>

  <p>From which he springs into the air to re-commence the phases with the
  left hind foot, while the only phase in which he has been discovered
  without support is one when the legs are flexed under the body. All of
  the feet at this time are nearly close together and have comparatively
  little independent motion; this phase, therefore, more persistently than
  any other, forces itself upon the attention of the careful observer, and
  conveys to him the impression of a horse's rapid motion in singular
  contradiction to the conventional interpretation, until quite recently,
  usually adopted by the Artist.</p>

  <p>It should not be understood that the term "spring" implies that the
  body of the horse is greatly elevated by that action; were it so, much
  force would be unnecessarily expended with the result of loss of speed.
  The center of gravity of a horse trotting or galloping at a high rate of
  speed will preserve an almost strictly horizontal line, the undulations
  being very slight.</p>

  <p>In the gallop of the horse it is probable there may be sometimes a
  period of suspension between the lifting of one fore foot and the descent
  of the other, but it has not yet been demonstrated.</p>

  <p>The method of galloping described applies to the horse and its allies,
  and to most of the cloven and soft-footed animals.</p>

  <p>In the gallop of the dog the sequence of foot falling and the action
  of the body is materially different, and the animal is free from support
  twice in each stride.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:29%;">
      <a href="images/illus_059.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illus_059.jpg"
      alt="The gallop of the dog." title="The gallop of the dog." /></a>
    THE GALLOP OF THE DOG.
  </div>

  <p>Assuming that a racing hound after a flight through the air with
  elongated body and extended legs (like the conventional galloping horse),
  lands upon the left fore foot, the right fore will next touch the ground;
  from this he will again spring into the air, and with curved body and
  flexed legs land upon the right hind foot, while the right fore feet will
  be half the length of the body to the rear. The left hind now descends,
  another flight is effected, and again the left fore repeats its functions
  of support and propulsion.</p>

  <p>These successive foot fallings are common to all dogs when galloping,
  and it is worthy of note that the same rotary action in the use of the
  limbs is adopted in the gallop of the elk, the deer and the antelope, all
  of which animals, like the dog, can for a time excel the horse in
  speed.</p>

  <p>A search through all the dictionaries published at the time of
  writing, and accessible to the Author, fails to discover a correct
  definition of "the gallop." This motion is in America frequently
  miscalled the "run," and its execution "running," but no corresponding
  explanation of the word is given by any lexicographer.</p>

  <p>In Scott's "Lady of the Lake" occurs "Then faint afar are heard the
  feet of rushing steeds in <i>gallop</i> fleet," many other distinguished
  Authors refer to the same action by the same name, by which, or its
  equivalents, it is universally known in Europe.</p>

<h5>THE LEAP.</h5>

  <p>There is little essential difference in general characteristics of
  either of the several movements that have been described, but with a
  number of experiments made with horses while leaping, no two were found
  to agree in the manner of execution. The leap of the same horse at the
  same rate of speed, with the same rider, over the same hurdle, disclosed
  much variation in the rise, clearance, and descent of the animal. A few
  phases were, however, invariable. While the horse was raising his body to
  clear the hurdle, one hind foot was always in advance of the other, which
  exercised its last energy alone.</p>

  <p>On the descent, the concussion was always first received by one fore
  foot, followed more or less rapidly by the other, sometimes as much as 30
  inches in advance of where the first one struck; the hind feet were also
  landed with intervals of time and distance.</p>

  <p>No attempt will be made to analyze the consecutive phases of various
  other acts of Animal Locomotion, such as rearing, bucking, kicking,
  tossing, etc., on account of the irregularity which characterizes their
  execution, and the difficulty of obtaining reliable data.</p>

  <p>The Author has vainly sought for the rules which govern the hind feet
  of a playfully disposed mule; but the inquiry has usually been
  unsatisfactory, and upon some occasions disastrous. Should these
  movements be controlled by any general law, it is of such a complex
  nature that all attempts to expound it have hitherto been fruitless.</p>

  <p>The figures in the series of circles (see appendix A) were selected
  from</p>

<blockquote class="b1s">

  <p>"ANIMAL LOCOMOTION"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>and arranged by the Author for his less ambitious work,</p>

<blockquote class="b1s">

  <p>"POPULAR ZOOPRAXOGRAPHY."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>(See Appendix C).</p>

  <p>They were traced by the well known artist, Erwin Faber, and are
  reproduced one-third the diameter of the circles arranged for the
  zoöpraxiscope. Many of the original phases of movement are omitted on
  account of the optical law which in the construction of a zoöpraxiscope
  requires that the number of illustrations must bear a certain
  relationship to the number of perforations through which they are
  viewed.</p>

  <p>The popular number of thirteen having been selected for the latter,
  the same number of figures illustrate actions without lateral progressive
  motion.</p>

  <p>When the number of illustrated phases is less than the number of
  perforations, the succession of phases is in the direction of the motion,
  and the disc is necessarily revolved in a reverse direction.</p>

  <p>When the number of phases is greater than the number of perforations,
  the phases succeed each other in a direction contrary to that of the
  motion, and the disc is revolved in the direction of the motion.</p>

  <p>An increased or diminished number of figures will respectively result
  in an increased or diminished apparent speed of the object.</p>

  gelatinised copper-plates, by the New York Photo-Gravure Company, on
  thick linen plate-paper.</p>

  <p>The size of the paper is 45 × 60 centimetres&mdash;(19 × 24 inches),
  and the printed surface varies from 15 × 45 to 20 × 30
  centimetres&mdash;(6 × 18 to 9 × 12 inches).</p>

  <p>The number of figures on each plate varies from 12 to 36.</p>

  <p>To publish so great a number of plates as one undivided work was
  considered unnecessary, for each subject tells its own story; and
  inexpedient, for it would defeat the object which the University had in
  view, and limit its acquisition to wealthy individuals, large Libraries,
  or Institutions where it would be beyond the reach of many who might
  desire to study it.</p>

  <p>It has, therefore, been decided to issue a series of One Hundred
  Plates, which number, for the purposes of publication, will be considered
  as a "COPY" of the work. These one hundred plates will probably meet the
  requirements of the greater number of the subscribers.</p>

  <p>In accordance with this view is re-issued the following
  prospectus.</p>

  <p>The Plates are enclosed in a strong, canvas-lined, full <span

  <p>Additional Plates in any required number will be supplied to the
  subscriber at the same proportionate rate; these, however, must be
  ordered at the same time as the subscription Plates.</p>

  <p>It was considered inadvisable to make an <i>arbitrary</i> selection of
  the one hundred Plates offered to subscribers, and with the object of
  meeting, as far as possible, their diverse requirements, they are invited
  to make their own selection, either from the subjoined list of subjects,
  or from a detailed catalogue, which will be forwarded free of expense to
  every subscriber.</p>

  <p>Should the selection be made from the Catalogue, it will be advisable
  to give the Author permission to change any one of the selected Plates
  for any other illustrating the same action, if, in his judgment, the
  substituted Plate illustrates that action with a better model, or in a
  more perfect manner than the one selected.</p>

  <p>With regard to the selection of Plates, however, it has been found by
  experience that unless any special subject or plate is required it will
  be more satisfactory to the subscriber if he gives the Author GENERAL
  INSTRUCTIONS as to the CLASS of subjects desired and to leave the
  SPECIFIC selection to him.</p>

  <p>Many of the large Libraries and Art or Science Institutions in America
  and in Europe have subscribed for, and have now in their possession, a
  complete series of the seven hundred and eighty-one Plates, the
  subscription price for which is</p>

<h5 class="scac">FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS</h5>

  <p>in the United States,</p>

<h5 class="scac">ONE HUNDRED GUINEAS</h5>

  <p>in Great Britain for the complete series, in eight full <span
  class="sc">American-Russia leather portfolios</span>, or if bound in
  eleven volumes, each plate <i>hinged</i>, full American-Russia
  leather,</p>

<h5 class="scac">FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS</h5>

  <p>in the United States,</p>

<h5 class="scac">ONE HUNDRED AND TEN GUINEAS</h5>

  <p>in Great Britain; or its equivalent for any city in Central or Western
  Europe.</p>

  <p>Subscribers who wish to make use of these Plates for the promotion or
  diffusion of knowledge, or for artistic or scientific purposes, will be
  afforded facilities for acquiring working copies by special arrangement
  with the Author.</p>

  <p>The investigations of the Author are so well known; and so generally
  recognized as affording the only basis of truthful interpretation or
  accurate criticism of Animal Movement, that it is perhaps scarcely
  necessary to quote from the many elaborate reviews of "Animal
  Locomotion," which have been published in the American, English, French,
  and German Scientific, Artistic, and other Journals. A few extracts
  therefrom are however given in Appendix A.</p>

  <p>For the value of the present work to the general student of Nature and
  the lover of Art, no less than to the Artist and the Archæologist, the
  Physiologist and the Anatomist, it is with much pride and gratitude that
  he refers to the annexed list of some of his subscribers.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
